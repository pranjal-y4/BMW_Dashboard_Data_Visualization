# BMW Sales Analysis Dashboard (2010–2024)

An interactive multi-view visualization dashboard built using **Python, Dash, Plotly, Pandas and NumPy**.  
The artefact analyses BMW’s global sales data from 2010–2024, supporting temporal, spatial, hierarchical and pricing-related analytical tasks.

This project was developed as part of **CS7DS4 / CSU44056 — Data Visualization**.

## 📊 Overview

The dashboard integrates **six coordinated visualization idioms**:

1. **Animated Fuel Mix Bar Chart** – shows year-by-year changes in fuel composition.  
2. **Global Sales Map + Distance Metric** – aggregates sales by region and overlays great-circle distance from BMW HQ.  
3. **Color → Model Sunburst** – reveals hierarchical customer colour preferences.  
4. **Faceted Fuel × Transmission Trend Chart** – category-specific temporal trends using small multiples.  
5. **Average Price by Model Bar Chart** – pricing tiers across BMW’s lineup.  
6. **Depreciation Curve** – relationship between mileage and price for a selected model.

These visualizations update dynamically through **global filters** (year range, region, fuel type, model).
